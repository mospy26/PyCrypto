# PyCrypto

This is a very basic pycrypto library implemetation

To use this, do the following:
```
1. git clone https://github.com/mospy26/Python-Cryptography.git
2. source ./cryptography/bin/activate (in home directory of project)
3. Run the program block.py for AES block mode.
```

You would need imagemagick in your computer.
To install this in MacOS, in the terminal, execute the following commands:

```
brew uninstall --force imagemagick # if you have imagemagick you might wanna uninstall it
brew install imagemagick@6
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/imagemagick@6/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
brew link imagemagick@6 --force
```
